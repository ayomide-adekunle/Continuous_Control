# Project 2: Continuous Control

### Introduction

For this project, you will work with the [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment.

![Trained Agent][image1]

In this project, I bukt an RL agent that control a double-jointed arm to move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

To effectively train our agent, an avergae score of +30 averaged across all 20 agents for 100 consecutive episodes must be achieved.

## Summary of Environment
- Set-up: Double-jointed arm which can move to target locations.
- Goal: Each agent must move its hand to the goal location, and keep it there.
- Agents: The environment contains 20 agents linked to a single Brain.
- Agent Reward Function (independent):
  - +0.1 for each timestep agent's hand is in goal location.
- Brains: One Brain with the following observation/action space.
  - Vector Observation space: 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the two arm Rigidbodies.
  - Vector Action space: (Continuous) Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.
  - Visual Observations: None.
- Reset Parameters: Two, corresponding to goal size, and goal movement speed.
- Benchmark Mean Reward: 30

## Agent Implementation

These are the steps I took in the implementation of the Agent

1. Evaluate the state and action space.
1. Establish performance baseline using a random action policy.
1. Select an appropriate algorithm and begin implementing it.
1. Run experiments, make revisions, and retrain the agent until the performance threshold is reached.
